For a M5Cardputer, this project which will start with a simplistic version of a 1980s Deathmaze game and later morph into larger game projects on the M5 cardputer

Note all the .png files should be loaded into the root of the sd card on the m5 computer.
at this point not all the .pngs are used by the code but they are all the "views" required 
by my simple mazemap...

Currently the ino just acts like a slide show which simulates a short walk around a couple of corners in the maze...
